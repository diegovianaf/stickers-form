# Stickers Form

Project developed from the [VAGAS.com](https://github.com/VAGAScom/desafio-front-end) challenge.

## Features

- Semantic HTML
- Buttons to increase or decrease the quantity of items
- Form validation

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to update the counter inside the input and make the value the same as valueAsNumber, when the click and change events happen.

I had some difficulty validating the checkboxes, but I hope I was able to make sure that the form is not sent if any checkbox is not selected.

## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- ESLint
